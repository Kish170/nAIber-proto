# When Claude Gets Stuck

If you have attempted the same fix more than twice 
without success, stop and do the following:

1. **Summarize what you tried** — list each approach 
   and why it failed
2. **State what you know for certain** — what parts 
   of the problem are confirmed vs assumed
3. **Propose three different approaches** — each must 
   be genuinely different, not variations of the same idea
4. **Recommend one with reasoning** — which approach 
   do you think is most likely to work and why
5. **Wait for approval** — do not attempt any approach 
   until confirmed

Do not keep trying variations of the same failing 
approach. Change strategy entirely.
